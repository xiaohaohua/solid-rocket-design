# Solid-rocket-design
course design of the solild rocket engine
## How to use it
* install python and its libary such as numpy,scipy,matplotlib
if you are a new programmer,I recommond you to install [Anacond3](https://www.anaconda.com/download/),remember to use python3,because the code is buliding on python3
* open spider(or you can use other commander if you are familiar with python)
* change the parametres in originals.data,please pay attention to the unit of the variables.after several trials,you can find the results at process.data,and the change of buring areas by e
will be saved as graph1
## about the code
* The first part of the code is heat calculation.I suggest you to control e1 near by 0.25*D,therefore you can easily make sure y1 at the range of 0.8 and 1.2.My suggestion is to control y1 at 0.8,because the loading cofficient is limited to 0.75 and 0.85.If you get the wrong information,it is because I set several triggers,once your parametres is not fitable,it will be triggered.The best way to solve this problem is to change your parametres.
* The secod part and the third part is to select the design.There are several vertifies.
