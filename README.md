# Solid-rocket-design
course design of the solild rocket engine
## How to use it
* install python and its libary such as numpy,scipy,matplotlib
if you are a new programmer,I recommond you to install [Anacond3](https://www.anaconda.com/download/),remember to use python3,because the code is buliding on python3
* open spider(or you can use other commander if you are familiar with python)
* change the parametres in originals.data,please pay attention to the unit of the variables.after several trials,you can find the results at process.data,and the change of buring areas by e
will be saved as graph1
## about the code
* The first part of the code is to select the design.I suggest you to control e1 near by 0.25*D,therefore you can easily make sure y1 at the range of 0.8 and 1.2.My suggestion is to control y1 at 0.8,because the loading cofficient is limited to 0.75 and 0.85.
